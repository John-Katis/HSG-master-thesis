\chapter*{Declaration of Auxiliary Aids}

The creation of this dissertation involved a lot of third-party software, including AI-based tools.
I declare all uses of third-party software in the dissertation text that contributed non-trivially to the dissertation's content and are non-standard in such research.
Further, by the University of St.\ Gallen's decree II.B.1.20 section 5.3, I explicitly declare the following uses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Private proofreading, DeepL, Google Bard, Google Translate, Grammarly (Premium), LanguageTool, and OpenAI ChatGPT (Plus),
    in their current versions available between 2019 and May 2024,
     have been used for spellchecking, grammar checking, and enhancing the conciseness and clarity of the dissertation text.
    \item Google Bard, OpenAI ChatGPT (Plus), and Pulumi AI,
    in their current versions available between 2022 and January 2024,
    have been used for brainstorming.
\end{itemize}
